389. Find the Difference
Easy
Topics
Companies
You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

 Example 1:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
Example 2:

Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 1000
t.length == s.length + 1
s and t consist of lowercase English letters.

class Solution {
    findTheDifference(s, t) {
        let result = 0;
        for (const char of s) {
            result ^= char.charCodeAt(0);
        }
        for (const char of t) {
            result ^= char.charCodeAt(0);
        }
        return String.fromCharCode(result);
    }
}

// Example usage:
const solution = new Solution();
const s = "abc";
const t = "abcd";
console.log(solution.findTheDifference(s, t)); // Output: "d"
