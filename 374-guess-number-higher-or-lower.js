374. Guess Number Higher or Lower

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:

-1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).
Return the number that I picked.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
Example 2:

Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: n = 2, pick = 1
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 231 - 1
1 <= pick <= n

*/

// Replace this function with your own implementation of the guess API
function guess(num) {
    // Your logic here
    // Return -1 if num is higher, 1 if lower, and 0 if equal
}

function guessNumber(n) {
    let left = 1;
    let right = n;

    while (left <= right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        const result = guess(mid);

        if (result === 0) {
            return mid;
        } else if (result === -1) {
            right = mid - 1;
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }

    return -1; // Not found (shouldn't happen in this problem)
}

// Example usage:
const pickedNumber = guessNumber(100);
console.log(`The picked number is: ${pickedNumber}`);
